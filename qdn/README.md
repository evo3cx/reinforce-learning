This folder help me to understand Depp Q-Learning better.

The hands-on 👉 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/unit3/unit3.ipynb)

The leaderboard 👉 https://huggingface.co/spaces/chrisjay/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Leaderboard

You can work directly **with the colab notebook, which allows you not to have to install everything on your machine (and it’s free)**.

4️⃣ The best way to learn **is to try things on your own**. That’s why we have a challenges section in the colab where we give you some ideas on how you can go further: using another environment, using another model etc.
